# Application Form

A Yawik application form is a standalone Single Page Application (SPA). It is static 
HTML code combined with Javascript and CSS that runs in the applicant's browser. The 
form thus offers the applicant a maximum of user-friendliness. Already during the 
input of the application data, the applicant is signaled that data is entered 
correctly or incorrectly.
